                    <h3>Dancing</h3>
                    <p>When i was young i never liked dancing but i still gave it a try, it took me a while but i started liking it more and more evrey class thanks to my teacher which i'm thankful for. Currently, i've been dancing for around 9 years and somewhere close to 7-6 years in competition level and i love it! and yes, i know it sounds weird for a guy to dance but what can i say. I've tried many styles and my favorite one is Hip Hop so far, because your more free than styles like jazz, ballet, etc. My main focus right now is Hip Hop and becoming a pro dancer while showing the world what i can do</p>

                    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
                    <p>First puzzle i learned to solve was a 3x3x3 rubik's cube when i was around 10. It took me a month to learn the basic algorithms which wasn't easy but payed of. My best was around a minute and now after learning the advanced method and many more algorithms i can solve it in less than 20 seconds!. I have alot more puzzles i can solve like the mirror cube, megaminx, 5x5x5 and more.</p>
